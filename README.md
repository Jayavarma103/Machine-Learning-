These are Mini-Projects based on applications of ML Algorithm. Each folder contains solutions to given data and problem statements. 
The Problem statements are:
            1) Linear Regression: Predicting the yearly amount spent by customers in a fashion e-commerce startup. 
            2) Logistic Regression: Identifying the type of plastic found in sea given its remains from the sea.
            3) K-NN Algorithm: Categorize the given potions into four different categories based on their compositions from given data.
            4) Support Vector Machines (SVM): Develop a model to determine contamination levels of water from the river Ganga. 
            5) Desicion Trees: Develop a model to identify fake passports from given labelled dataset.
